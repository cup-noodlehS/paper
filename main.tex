\chapter{THE PROBLEM AND ITS SCOPE}
\section{Rationale}
Road traffic injuries remain a major public-safety concern, causing about 1.19 million deaths globally each year, with the burden falling disproportionately on low- and middle-income countries where most road fatalities occur \parencite{WHO2023Road}. In the Philippines, road crashes continue to impose substantial losses, with the WHO estimating 11,062 road traffic fatalities in 2021 \parencite{WHO2023PH}. Strengthening compliance with traffic laws is therefore a practical lever for improving road safety, but conventional, fully manual enforcement is difficult to scale consistently across dense urban road networks \parencite{Olugbade2022}. As a response, jurisdictions increasingly use camera-based enforcement and video analytics, as reflected locally by the No-Contact Apprehension Policy (NCAP) that relies on recorded visual evidence for apprehension and adjudication \parencite{MMDA2022}. However, real-world deployments face persistent technical issues---such as congestion, occlusion, viewpoint changes, and illumination variability---that directly affect the reliability of detection and tracking in traffic scenes \parencite{Wen2020}. In addition, computer vision models trained on popular datasets can exhibit dataset bias and degraded performance under distribution shift, which can manifest as inconsistent detections across vehicle types and appearances that differ from the original training domain, and such inconsistencies can propagate to unstable identities in Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) and undermine trajectory-based violation reasoning \parencite{Koh2021,TorralbaEfros2011,Wen2020}. Prior work shows that automated traffic-violation detection commonly uses a pipeline of object detection (e.g., You Only Look Once [YOLO]) plus MOT plus rule/behavior analysis, enabling offense inference from trajectories rather than single-frame cues \parencite{Olugbade2022,RedmonFarhadi2018,Zhang2022}. Because enforcement systems also benefit from transparent and auditable decision logic, coupling learned perception (detections and tracks) with geometric and lane-based rules provides a more interpretable basis for violation reasoning than purely end-to-end black-box offense classification \parencite{Olugbade2022,Rathore2021}. Motivated by these constraints, the study further incorporates fuzzy logic as a mechanism for representing and managing uncertainty in tracking decisions, consistent with the fuzzy set approach to reasoning under imprecision \parencite{Zadeh1965} and with prior research applying fuzzy decision mechanisms in video tracking contexts \parencite{Fakhri2023}.
\section{Statement of the Problem}
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated traffic-violation detection can help scale monitoring and evidence capture, but practical deployment depends on building a vision pipeline that remains reliable under real traffic conditions, where congestion and occlusions are frequent and where detection confidence can fluctuate across frames \parencite{Olugbade2022,Wen2020}. Performance can further degrade under adverse weather and challenging lighting (e.g., rain and glare), increasing the risk of missed detections and unstable tracks that weaken trajectory-based inference \parencite{Brophy2023,Wen2020}. Moreover, because popular pre-trained object detectors may not generalize consistently under distribution shift, inconsistencies in detections and class outputs can occur in deployment environments that differ from training datasets, which can destabilize MOT associations and reduce the reliability of geometric rule-based violation detection \parencite{Koh2021,TorralbaEfros2011,Zhang2022}. Guided by these realities and by the operational direction of camera-based enforcement that relies on recorded video evidence \parencite{MMDA2022}, this study addresses the following problems:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Detection Consistency for Tracking:} How can a YOLO-based detector be configured and evaluated so that its outputs remain sufficiently consistent across frames and traffic conditions to support downstream MOT and geometric violation inference? \parencite{RedmonFarhadi2018,Wen2020}
  \item \textbf{Uncertainty-Handling in MOT via Fuzzy Logic:} How can fuzzy logic be integrated into MOT decision-making (e.g., association or class-consistency handling) to manage uncertainty arising from detector-score fluctuations and out-of-distribution conditions, thereby improving track stability for enforcement-grade trajectory analysis? \parencite{Fakhri2023,Zadeh1965,Zhang2022}
  \item \textbf{Geometric Rule-Based Violation Inference:} How can deterministic geometric rules (e.g., lane/region constraints and boundary-crossing logic) be formulated and validated so that violations inferred from tracks are consistent, explainable, and scenario-appropriate? \parencite{Rathore2021,Olugbade2022}
  \item \textbf{Speed Estimation From Trajectories:} How can camera-based speed estimation (when needed for enforcement logic) be implemented in a measurable and repeatable way so that error propagation into speed-related decisions is minimized? \parencite{Olugbade2022,Shubho2021}
  \item \textbf{Weather and Lighting Resilience:} How can the pipeline mitigate performance degradation caused by rain, glare, and low-light conditions common in outdoor surveillance so that detection and tracking remain usable for evidence generation? \parencite{Brophy2023,Wen2020}
  \item \textbf{Evidence Packaging for Review:} How can the system generate a clear evidence bundle (e.g., annotated frames, timestamps, track identifiers, and rule-trigger traces) aligned with no-contact apprehension workflows that rely on video evidence? \parencite{MMDA2022,Olugbade2022}
\end{enumerate}
\section{Research Objectives}
This study aims to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven traffic violation detection pipeline that combines YOLO-based vehicle detection with multi-object tracking (MOT) and deterministic geometric rules, so that violations can be inferred from trajectory behavior over time rather than relying only on single-frame cues \parencite{RedmonFarhadi2018,Zhang2022}. The study is designed around the practical observation that deploying popular pre-trained detectors in ``in-the-wild'' settings can experience performance inconsistencies due to dataset bias and distribution shift, which can manifest as unstable or inconsistent recognition of locally common vehicle types not well represented in the original training domain \parencite{Koh2021,TorralbaEfros2011}. In the Philippine context, where two-wheel vehicles are widely used and motorcycles comprise a large portion of registered vehicles, such inconsistencies can affect downstream tracking stability and violation inference quality \parencite{Inquirer2021,TorralbaEfros2011}. Specifically, the study seeks to:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Implement a tracking-by-detection MOT pipeline that maintains stable vehicle identities across frames under occlusion, entry/exit events, and fluctuating detection confidence commonly observed in real traffic video \parencite{Wen2020,Zhang2022}.
  \item Design and integrate a fuzzy logic-based mechanism within MOT (e.g., for association or class-consistency handling) to explicitly manage uncertainty and reduce identity/class instability caused by detector-score variability and domain shift \parencite{Fakhri2023,Zadeh1965}.
  \item Formulate and validate interpretable geometric and region-based rules (e.g., lane boundary crossing, prohibited region entry, and other trajectory--boundary relations) to infer traffic violations from tracked trajectories in an auditable manner \parencite{Olugbade2022,Rathore2021}.
  \item Evaluate the system's violation detection performance and robustness across typical surveillance conditions (e.g., varying illumination, partial occlusions, and perspective distortion) that are known to affect detection and tracking consistency in traffic scenes \parencite{Wen2020,Zhang2022}.
  \item Produce evidence-oriented outputs (e.g., annotated frames, timestamps, track identifiers, and rule-trigger traces) that support review and verification of detected violations within camera-based enforcement workflows \parencite{MMDA2022,Olugbade2022}.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Theoretical Framework}
This study adopts a pipeline-oriented framework for automated traffic violation detection (ATVD) in which a violation is treated as a temporal event inferred from object trajectories, rather than as a purely frame-level classification outcome \parencite{Olugbade2022,Wen2020}. The framework is grounded in three coupled layers: perception, temporal continuity, and rule-based violation reasoning, which reflect how many practical systems operationalize traffic video analytics for monitoring and enforcement \parencite{Olugbade2022,Wen2020}.

In the perception layer, YOLO-based object detection produces frame-level observations (bounding boxes and classes) for vehicles at real-time-friendly speeds, providing the primary inputs required by downstream tracking \parencite{RedmonFarhadi2018}. However, modern computer vision models trained on large datasets can exhibit dataset-specific ``signatures'' and cross-dataset generalization gaps, meaning that performance can degrade when the deployment environment differs from the training environment \parencite{Koh2021,TorralbaEfros2011}. Such distribution shifts can be amplified in traffic monitoring due to differences in camera viewpoint, local vehicle taxonomy, and scene context \parencite{Koh2021,Wen2020}.

In the temporal continuity layer, MOT is used to associate detections across frames to yield stable identities and trajectories, enabling reasoning about lane-level behaviors and movements across regions of interest \parencite{Wen2020}. Tracking-by-detection methods emphasize that identity fragmentation often arises when low-confidence detections are discarded or when association is brittle under occlusion and score fluctuations \parencite{Zhang2022}. To address uncertainty arising from imperfect detections and domain shift, this study incorporates fuzzy logic as an uncertainty-handling mechanism within MOT, leveraging the fuzzy set principle of graded membership to represent ambiguous evidence and support more stable decision-making under imprecision \parencite{Fakhri2023,Zadeh1965}.

In the violation reasoning layer, geometric rules translate trajectories into interpretable violation events by evaluating track movements relative to lane boundaries, stop lines, or prohibited regions, which supports auditability compared to purely end-to-end ``black-box'' offense classification \parencite{Olugbade2022,Rathore2021}. This approach aligns with prior lane- and region-based violation detection work, where road geometry (lines, lanes, and zones) acts as the explicit constraint system against which tracked movement is evaluated \parencite{Olugbade2022,Rathore2021}. Taken together, the framework positions reliable detection as necessary but not sufficient: consistent tracking and explicit rule reasoning are treated as the core mechanisms that enable explainable, reviewable violation inference in real-world traffic surveillance \parencite{Olugbade2022,Zhang2022}.
\section{Significance of the Study}
This study is significant because road traffic injury remains a major public safety issue globally, and effective traffic law enforcement and compliance are widely recognized as important contributors to reducing crash risks and related harms \parencite{WHO2023Road}. In practice, scaling enforcement through video analytics can reduce reliance on continuous manual monitoring while enabling consistent capture of observable driving behaviors, particularly in dense urban settings where violations can be frequent and transient \parencite{Olugbade2022,Wen2020}.

For Philippine-focused deployment, the study contributes by explicitly addressing the practical limitation that popular pre-trained detectors may behave inconsistently under local distribution shifts, potentially affecting the stability of downstream tracking and the reliability of rule-based violation inference \parencite{Koh2021,TorralbaEfros2011}. By integrating fuzzy logic into MOT, the study explores a principled way to represent uncertainty and stabilize decisions when evidence is noisy or partially conflicting---conditions that are typical in traffic surveillance and are amplified when the training domain differs from the deployment domain \parencite{Fakhri2023,Zadeh1965}. For traffic management stakeholders, the outputs of this work are intended to be evidence-oriented and reviewable (e.g., trajectories and rule-trigger traces), which supports operational verification and potential integration with camera-based apprehension practices that rely on recorded evidence \parencite{MMDA2022,Olugbade2022}. For researchers, the study offers an applied reference design that combines YOLO-based detection, MOT, fuzzy uncertainty handling, and geometric-rule inference, contributing to the growing body of work emphasizing that robust ``in-the-wild'' deployment requires explicit handling of distribution shift and uncertainty beyond standard in-domain benchmarks \parencite{Koh2021,Wen2020}.
\section{Scope and Delimitation}
This study focuses on traffic violations that can be inferred from vehicle trajectories and road geometry using monocular traffic video, specifically through a pipeline that integrates YOLO-based detection, MOT, fuzzy logic-assisted uncertainty handling in tracking, and geometric rules for violation inference \parencite{RedmonFarhadi2018,Olugbade2022,Zhang2022}. The scope includes designing region- and lane-based rule logic (e.g., boundary crossing and prohibited region entry) that can be operationalized using user-defined lane lines, zones, and reference boundaries within the camera view \parencite{Olugbade2022,Rathore2021}. The system evaluation is constrained to scenarios where the camera perspective and scene layout are sufficiently stable to allow consistent geometric rule application, consistent with common assumptions in lane- and region-based traffic analytics \parencite{Rathore2021,Wen2020}.

The study does not aim to develop a nationwide-ready generalized detector for all Philippine roads, because distribution shift across locations, cameras, and vehicle appearances is known to degrade out-of-distribution performance for machine learning systems \parencite{Koh2021,TorralbaEfros2011}. Instead, the work emphasizes improving practical consistency in tracking and rule inference under local vehicle and scene variability by introducing fuzzy logic into MOT to manage uncertainty \parencite{Fakhri2023,Zadeh1965}. The study also does not cover violations that require direct observation of driver attributes (e.g., helmet use, seatbelt use) or fine-grained interior cues, as these typically require different data and modeling assumptions than trajectory-based geometric reasoning \parencite{Brophy2023,Wen2020}. Additionally, the study does not include end-to-end legal adjudication processes; rather, it focuses on generating evidence-oriented, reviewable outputs (e.g., annotated trajectories and rule-trigger traces) that can support verification within camera-based traffic monitoring or enforcement workflows \parencite{MMDA2022,Olugbade2022}.
